                <h4>Our Solar System</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Our Solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago and is located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
                    Scientists estimate that there are billions of other solar systems in our galaxy, and that there are billions of galaxies
                    in the universe. Our solar system includes eight planets which rotate around the sun, dwarf planets like Pluto, and comets,
                    asteroids, and meteroid. Let's take a look at the plants in our Solar System.

                <h4>The Sun</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Although the sun is the center of the Solar System - containing 99.8% of its mass - it is technically classified as a star.
                        But do not let this classification fool you. The Sun may be an enormous ball of gas, but it is necessary to sustain life on Earth and has a core temperature of about
                        27 million degrees Fahrenheit. To put its size in perspective, if the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel.

                <h4>Mercury</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System. In fact, it is not much larger than the Earth's moon.
                    Out of all of the planets, Mercury is closest to the sun at a distance of about 36 million miles. Like Earth's moon,
                    Mercury has a solid, cratered surface which classifies it as a terrestrial planet.

                <h4>Venus</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Similar to Mercury, Venus is a rocky or terrestrial planet. Venus is an unlikely location for life as we know
                    it due to its extreme high temperatures of almost 900 degress fahrenheit, as well as its retrograde rotation. This
                    means that Venus spins backwards, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. 
                    </p>

                <h4>Earth</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Earth's solid and dynamic surface of mountains, valleys, canyons, plains, etc. classifies it as a terrestrial
                    planet; however, Earth differs from other terrestrial planets in that 70% of its surface is covered in oceans. The
                    Earth is the only known planet to have a breathable atmosphere able to support human life. It takes 365 days for
                    the Earth to complete a full orbit around the sun, but it takes only 24 hours for the Earth to rotate once around itself.

                <h4>Mars</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Like the Earth, Mars takes about 24 hours to rotate once around itself; however, a full orbit around the sun
                    takes 687 Earth days. Mars has a thin atmosphere and thus does not support life as we know it, but scientists are currently
                    studying Mars' past and future potential for life. Mars has two moons, and it is nicknamed the "Red Planet" because of the reddish
                    coloring of its soil and dusty atmosphere, which can be attributed to iron minerals in the Martian soil.

                <h4>Jupiter</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Jupiter is the largest, most massive planet in our Solar System. Jupiter is considered a gas giant since it lacks a solid
                    surface, and it was formed out of the material left over from the formation of the Sun. Jupiter's colorful appearance is attributed
                    to its fast rotation. The planet spins once every 10 hours which creates strong jet streams that smear its ammonia clouds into
                    bands across the planet. Jupiter's "Great Red Spot" is a gigantic storm the size of two or three Earths.

                <h4>Saturn</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant planet. Saturn differs from all other planets in that it has a unique system
                    of seven rings with gaps and divisions between them. Saturn also has 53 known moons, and there are 9 additional moons
                    awaiting confirmation of their discovery. Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun at a distance of about 886 million
                    miles.

                <h4>Uranus</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Uranus is a gas giant as well, but its surface is made up of a hot, dense fluid of icy materials like water, methane,
                    and ammonia. Uranus has 27 moons named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus
                    has faint rings which vary in color, and like Venus, Uranus has a retrograde rotation; however, it rotates on its side
                    which is different from any other planet.

                <h4>Neptune</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Neptune is a gas giant made of a very thick, very hot combination of water, ammonia, and methane. It has 13
                    confirmed moons which are named after various sea gods and nymphs of Greek mythology as well as six rings. Although
                    Neptune is the eigth planet from the sun, it is sometimes farther from the sun during its orbit than dwarf planet
                    Pluto due to Pluto's unusual elliptical orbit. 
                    </p>

                <h4>Pluto</h4>
                    <p class="Txt"> Pluto was considered our Solar System's ninth planet until 2006 when worlds deeper than the Kuiper Belt were
                    discovered. Since 2006, Pluto has been classified as a dwarf planet in the Kupier Belt which is a region of ice objects
                    beyond the orbit of Neptune. Pluto's atmosphere is unique in that it expands as it gets closer to the sun and collapses
                    as it moves farther away. Like all dwarf planets, Pluto is a solid rocky and icy body.
